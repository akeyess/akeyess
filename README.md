## Some Passions :cupid:
   - **Blockchain Technology**
      - Curious and in love and  about the future of blockchain use across the world. I'm a daily user of blockchain technology as well as a daily consumer of cryptocurrency media. Extensive knowledge of ***network protocols, tokenomics, wallets, exchanges, CBDCs, stablecoins, and gas fees***. Conducted [blockchain research on crypto mining](https://github.com/akeyess/Eth_Mining_Research_Report), a personal passion of mine which I wanted to learn more about. 
   - **Health & Fitness**
      - Huge believer in "***Health is Wealth***" and "***You Are What You Eat***". A healthy lifestyle doesn't have to be a challenge or a chore. I think everyone can live a happier life if they can live a healthier one. I would love to ***positively change*** the health of ***others*** with ***Research Methods and Data Science***.
   - **Entertainment**
      - Since a child I've been immersed in the entertainment industry, from TV shows and Gaming, to Social Media and YouTube. Extensive use of many social applications (***Facebook, Reddit, Discord, Instagram, Twitter***) I've always found myself looking to play strategy games and use strategy in online games, this hones in on my ***Common-Sense, Creative, and Problem Solving capabilities***.
