## Passions :cupid:
   - Blockchain Technology
      - In love and curious about the furture of blockchain use across the world. Daily user of blockchain technology as well as a daily consumer of cryptocurrency media. Extensive knowledge of network protocols, tokenomics, exchanges, CBDCs, stablecoins, and gas fees.
   - Health
      - I am a huge believer in "Health is Wealth" and "You are what you eat". Living a healthy lifestyle does not have to be a challenge, you can make it fun. I think everyone can live a happier life if they can live a healthier one. I would love to positively impact the health of others using research methods and data science.
   - Entertainment
      - Since a child I've been immersed in the entertainment industry, from TV shows and Gaming, to Social Media and YouTube. I've always found myself looking for a full understanding of what's going on. I would take the time to look through settings just cause I'd be curious.
